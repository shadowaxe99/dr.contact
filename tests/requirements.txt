As a full-stack developer, I understand that the "requirements.txt" file is not a code file but a list of Python packages that the project depends on. Here's what it might look like for this project:


Scrapy==2.5.0
pandas==1.2.4
openpyxl==3.0.7
xlrd==2.0.1
python-docx==0.8.11
PyPDF2==1.26.0
python-pptx==0.6.19
